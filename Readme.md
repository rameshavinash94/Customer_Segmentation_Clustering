ASSIGNMENT 1:

## Clustering K-means(Apply two clustering methods in your datasets)

1. Form a Team of two to four students.

2. Leverage the ML life-cycle:

### Find a business objective connected to it.
Dividing customers into groups for the purpose of targeting advertisements or promotions (based on purchasing patterns,purchase history)


### Find a data set, wrangle and prepare it.

Find what the data is saying : use unsupervised clustering algorithms to find clusters and interpret them.

2. Each student is to apply data wrangling, preparation and for clustering, k-means

Interpret the data. What story is the data telling us? What business problem can be solved using the data?

Notes: Please apply two clustering methods that covered in the lecture, you can refer the clustering methods at:


**ASSIGNMENT 2:**

1. Apply the Gaussian Mixture Model Algorithm to your  selected data set.

2. Select one other Clustering algorithm that you think would work well with your dataset, based on criteria written in:

https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_cluster_comparison.html (Links to an external site.)

3. Use the readings for week 2 from your course website as guidance for references, code examples.

4. Compare and contrast your recent clusterings (2) with the previous K-means.


**ASSIGNMENT 3:**

1. Apply fractal clustering on your dataset(s) : https://medium.com/uptick-blog/stock-picks-using-k-means-clustering-4330c6c4e8de (Links to an external site.)

1.1 Write 2 objective functions for your domain to find the golden cluster; check each cluster for values of the objective function to determine whether to stop re-clustering or not.

1.2 Compute SSE and Silhouette

2. Writeup on your project

2.1 what is the data narrative: what are the 2-3 main questions that your project is trying to answer?

Business task? e.g., Drug interactions/side effects
ML task? e.g., Link prediction: classify, cluster, predict (regression) 
what is it that you are trying to classify, cluster, predict
EDAV - structure, of data, visualization, distribution,
Data Representation [type]
2.2 what are the datasets

2 datasets : 2 downloaded 1 scraped [maybe not ready yet, but write up a spec for what type of data you want to scrape and possibly from where]

Read the reading for week 3 on the website and submit notes as a googledoc.
